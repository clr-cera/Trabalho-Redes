This repository stores two projects developed for [Computer Networks](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=SSC0540&codcur=55051&codhab=4) discipline at [ICMC - USP](https://www.icmc.usp.br/).

## Project 1
Under the Arduino folder you can find the files for the first project. 

That is the implementation of the networking layer 2 protocol RS-232-C for simplex communication between two arduino devices. Under the folder Emissor there's the source code for the transmitter. While in the folder Receptor there's the source code for the Receiver.

## Project 2
Under the SLOW folder you can find the files for the second project.

That is the source code in C++ for a peripheral according to the specifications of the networking layer 4 protocol "Slow".

Slow is built on top of UDP to deliver a similar data delivery reliability as TCP through faster and lighter implementation of sliding window flow control.
